## NOTICE: Full authors of this code can be found in the [LLVM PROJECT's main repo](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/tree/main/mlir/examples)
I prefer to have the samples out of tree, this is why I have created this project.     
Unfortunately, I am yet to think of a neat way to preserve the history. If you know please file an issue.
